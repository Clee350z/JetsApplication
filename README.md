Hello world!

#Things I struggled with

This project was a huge challenge for me. Understanding how to use interfaces, how to get the classes to implement those interfaces, the syntax of how to structure the classes themselves, ABSTRACT type... These are all things I now have a better understanding of. I still have a lot to learn.

#Lessons Learned
Always create a README, and dont work full time when attending a bootcamp.
